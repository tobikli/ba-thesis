= Requirements Analysis
#TODO[
  This chapter follows the Requirements Analysis Document Template in @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering. Important: Make sure that the whole chapter is independent of the chosen technology and development platform. The idea is that you illustrate concepts, taxonomies and relationships of the application domain independent of the solution domain! Cite @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering several times in this chapter.

== Proposed System
#TODO[
  If you leave out the section “Current system”, you can rename this section into “Requirements”.

=== Functional Requirements
#TODO[
  List and describe all functional requirements of your system. Also mention requirements that you were not able to realize. The short title should be in the form “verb objective”

  - FR2 Short Title: Short Description. 
  - FR3 Short Title: Short Description.

=== Nonfunctional Requirements
#TODO[
  List and describe all nonfunctional requirements of your system. Also mention requirements that you were not able to realize. Categorize them using the FURPS+ model described in @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering without the category functionality that was already covered with the functional requirements.

=== Analysis Object Model
#TODO[
  This subsection should contain a UML Class Diagram showing the most important objects, attributes, methods and relations of your application domain including taxonomies using specification inheritance (see @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering). Do not insert objects, attributes or methods of the solution domain. *Important:* Make sure to describe the analysis object model thoroughly in the text so that readers are able to understand the diagram. Also write about the rationale how and why you modeled the concepts like this.

=== Dynamic Model
#TODO[
  This subsection should contain dynamic UML diagrams. These can be a UML state diagrams, UML communication diagrams or UML activity diagrams.*Important:* Make sure to describe the diagram and its rationale in the text. *Do not use UML sequence diagrams.*
