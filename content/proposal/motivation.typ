Cloud-based IDEs like Theia Cloud are increasingly important in modern education, where interactive coding environments support practical learning @zander:2024:DevelopingImprovedCode. As these platforms become more widely adopted, their reliability and scalability directly affect the learning experience. In Artemis, a well-tested Theia Cloud improves accessibility and efficiency, particularly during periods of high usage such as programming exams.

A robust and responsive IDE means seamless learning experiences without technical disruptions for students. When programming exams and assignments run without problems, participating students can focus on solving problems without any worries about potential system issues @turdiu:2020:OnlineExamsArtemis. Automated testing and performance evaluation ensure that code editing, execution, and version control work as expected across different scenarios, reducing frustration and improving overall engagement. Research on online learning environments highlights that system stability directly influences student satisfaction and learning outcomes @muller:2021:FacilitatingFlexibleLearning.

Instructors benefit from a consistent and reliable development environment that supports the design of complex exercises without technical constraints. End-to-end testing contributes to maintaining this consistency by validating core functionality across updates.

Scientifically, testing cloud-based, interactive systems remains a relevant challenge in the fields of software quality assurance and performance engineering @paul:2001:EndtoendIntegrationTesting. This thesis contributes a systematic approach to evaluating the correctness and scalability of Theia Cloud, with the broader goal of supporting the reliable operation of browser-based IDEs in educational contexts.
