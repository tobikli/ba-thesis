Modern software development increasingly relies on cloud-based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to provide accessible, scalable, and collaborative coding environments @wu:2011:CEclipseOnlineIDE. One such platform is Theia Cloud #footnote("https://www.theia-ide.org/"), a fully browser-based IDE designed for flexibility and extensibility. Unlike traditional desktop IDEs, Theia Cloud eliminates the need for local installations, enabling seamless access to development tools from any device. This makes it particularly well-suited for educational institutions, where students and instructors require a consistent and scalable development environment.

At the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Artemis integrates with Theia Cloud, a learning management system that supports programming, modeling, and quiz-based exercises with (semi-)automatic assessment @schmidt:2024:InclusiveLearningEnvironments. Artemis enables students to complete coding assignments directly within the browser, while instructors can evaluate submissions efficiently @krusche:2018:ArTEMiSAutomaticAssessment. In the Winter Semester 24/25, the School of Computation, Information and Technology enrolled over 14.000 #footnote("TUM in Zahlen, 10.03.2025") <tiz> students, many of whom regularly used Artemis for their courses. Ensuring the usability and performance of Theia Cloud within Artemis is crucial, especially during high-demand periods such as programming exams, where many students access the system simultaneously.

Theia Cloud currently integrates with Artemis via a custom extension for Theia Cloud @jandow:2024:ScorpioVisualStudio and uniquely created Theia instances for each Artemis user @schmidt:2024:InclusiveLearningEnvironments. This extension allows students to open Artemis assignments in Theia Cloud and submit their solutions directly within the IDE. However, this integration is not without its challenges.
