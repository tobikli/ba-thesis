= Introduction

Modern software development increasingly relies on cloud-based Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to provide scalable, accessible, and collaborative coding platforms @wu:2011:CEclipseOnlineIDE. One such environment is Theia Cloud, a fully browser-based IDE designed for extensibility and device-independent access. Its flexibility makes it particularly attractive for educational settings, where students and instructors require consistent, ready-to-use development environments.

At the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Theia Cloud is integrated into Artemis, a learning management system that supports programming, modeling, and quiz-based exercises with (semi-)automatic assessment @schmidt:2024:InclusiveLearningEnvironments. This integration enables students to complete coding assignments directly in the browser and allows instructors to evaluate submissions efficiently @krusche:2018:ArTEMiSAutomaticAssessment. In the Winter Semester 2024/25, the School of Computation, Information and Technology enrolled over 14,000 #footnote("TUM in Zahlen, 10.03.2025") <tiz> students, many of whom actively used Artemis.

Theia Cloud connects to Artemis via a custom extension that launches a dedicated Theia instance for each student @jandow:2024:ScorpioVisualStudio. While this enables a seamless development and submission workflow, the integration introduces technical challengesâ€”particularly in terms of performance and reliability under high load. These aspects are critical during exam scenarios, where hundreds of students may interact with the system simultaneously.
