= System Design
#TODO[
  This chapter follows the System Design Document Template in @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering. You describe in this chapter how you map the concepts of the application domain to the solution domain. Some sections are optional, if they do not apply to your problem. Cite @bruegge:2004:ObjectorientedSoftwareEngineering several times in this chapter.
]

== Overview
#TODO[
  Provide a brief overview of the software architecture and references to other chapters (e.g. requirements analysis), references to existing systems, constraints impacting the software architecture..
]

== Design Goals
#TODO[
  Derive design goals from your nonfunctional requirements, prioritize them (as they might conflict with each other) and describe the rationale of your prioritization. Any trade-offs between design goals (e.g., build vs. buy, memory space vs. response time), and the rationale behind the specific solution should be described in this section
]

== Subsystem Decomposition
#TODO[
  Describe the architecture of your system by decomposing it into subsystems and the services provided by each subsystem. Use UML class diagrams including packages / components for each subsystem.
]

== Hardware Software Mapping
#TODO[
  This section describes how the subsystems are mapped onto existing hardware and software components. The description is accompanied by a UML deployment diagram. The existing components are often off-the-shelf components. If the components are distributed on different nodes, the network infrastructure and the protocols are also described.
