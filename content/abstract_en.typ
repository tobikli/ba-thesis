Theia is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) increasingly adopted in educational environments, including the Artemis system at the Technical University of Munich. As web-based learning platforms become more interactive and student-centered, the reliability and scalability of tools like Theia are critical, particularly during high-stakes scenarios such as programming exams, where hundreds of students may simultaneously rely on the IDE. However, current testing approaches fall short in validating Theia’s behavior under such conditions, especially when considering real-world interactive usage patterns.

This thesis addresses the dual challenge of ensuring both functional correctness and performance scalability of Theia in an educational context. The first part of the work focuses on developing a maintainable and realistic end-to-end (E2E) test suite using Playwright. These tests simulate key user interactions such as authentication via Keycloak, launching language-specific IDE instances, navigating files, editing code, and working with version control systems. The goal is to identify functional regressions early, especially in areas where traditional unit or integration tests are insufficient.

The second part of the thesis investigates Theia’s scalability and load tolerance when exposed to simultaneous student usage. Theia’s dynamic instance model and high reliance on real-time browser rendering introduce unique challenges for automated load testing. To address this, the thesis explores orchestrating Playwright-driven browser sessions to simulate concurrent usage. A dedicated test infrastructure is established to generate realistic student behavior at scale. The focus is not on benchmarking raw throughput, but on identifying performance bottlenecks and behavioral degradations in realistic usage scenarios.

By combining correctness-driven E2E testing with interactive load simulation, this thesis provides a comprehensive strategy for evaluating the robustness and scalability of modern browser-based IDEs like Theia. The findings aim to support the continued integration of Theia into large-scale educational platforms by offering both actionable insights and reusable testing infrastructure.
