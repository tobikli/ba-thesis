Theia is a browser-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) increasingly adopted in educational environments, including the Artemis #footnote("https://artemis.tum.de") system at the Technical University of Munich. As web-based learning platforms become more interactive and student-centered, the reliability and scalability of tools like Theia are important, particularly during critical scenarios such as programming exams, where hundreds of students may simultaneously rely on the IDE. However, current testing approaches fail to validate Theia's behavior under such conditions, especially when considering real-world interactive usage patterns.

This thesis addresses the dual challenge of ensuring both functional correctness and performance scalability of Theia in an educational context. The first part of the work focuses on developing a maintainable and realistic end-to-end (E2E) test suite using Playwright. These tests simulate key user interactions to identify functional regressions.

The second part of the thesis investigates Theia's scalability and load tolerance when exposed to simultaneous student usage. Theia's dynamic instance model and high reliance on real-time browser rendering introduce unique challenges for automated load testing. To address this, the thesis explores orchestrating Playwright-driven browser sessions to simulate concurrent usage.
