  abstract = {In recent years, learning process data have become increasingly easy to collect through computer-based learning environments. This has led to increased interest in the field of               learning analytics               , which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of               IDE-based learning analytics               . In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1)               Collect data,               (2)               Analyze data,               (3)               Design intervention,               and (4)               Deliver intervention               . For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing               effective               interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics.},

In this paper, we investigate the testing challenges of future web applications and propose a testing methodology that addresses these challenges by the integration of searchbased testing, model-based testing, oracle learning, concurrency testing, combinatorial testing, regression testing, and coverage analysis. This paper also presents a testing metamodel that states testing concepts and their relationships, which are used as the theoretical basis of the proposed testing methodology.},

This systematic review aims to investigate the impact of replacing classroom time with an online learning environment. The meta-analysis (k = 21 effect sizes) applied strict inclusion criteria concerning research design, measurement of learning outcomes and implementation of blended learning. The estimated effect size (Hedge's g) was positive, although not significantly different from zero and the confidence interval [-0.13, 0.25], suggesting that overall differences between blended and conventional classroom learning are small, and, at best, very small negative or moderate positive effects are plausible. This means that despite a reduction in classroom time between 30 and 79 per cent, equivalent learning outcomes were found. Consequently, blended learning with reduced classroom time is not systematically more or less effective than conventional classroom learning.},

To respond to this need, DoD recently initiates a project on End-to-End (E2E) integration testing. This approach takes the functional approach to integration testing even though design and architecture information can be also incorporated into the test specification. This approach also allows risk analysis, test case/script generation, regression testing, ripple effect analysis, statistical analysis, and remote project management and collaboration via XML.},

We recruited 69 participants from a psychology course to take classroom- and online-delivered exams, using a counterbalanced crossover design. We found that students who normally experience high levels of test anxiety in the classroom had reduced test anxiety when taking online exams, while the reverse was true for those low in classroom anxiety. Furthermore, the relationship between test anxiety and exam performance was weaker in an online setting than in the classroom. We recommend that instructors evaluate the potential impact of these findings when considering offering examinations online.},

As the scope and complexity of software systems continue to grow, the need for more effective software testing techniques becomes increasingly urgent, making it an area ripe for innovative approaches such as the use of LLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the utilization of LLMs in software testing. It analyzes 102 relevant studies that have used LLMs for software testing, from both the software testing and LLMs perspectives. The paper presents a detailed discussion of the software testing tasks for which LLMs are commonly used, among which test case preparation and program repair are the most representative. It also analyzes the commonly used LLMs, the types of prompt engineering that are employed, as well as the accompanied techniques with these LLMs. It also summarizes the key challenges and potential opportunities in this direction. This work can serve as a roadmap for future research in this area, highlighting potential avenues for exploration, and identifying gaps in our current understanding of the use of LLMs in software testing.},
