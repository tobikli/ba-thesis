  abstract = {Higher education institutions are trying to provide more flexibility and individualization, which is mainly realized through the use of new technologies and implemented in online or blended learning designs. This systematic review aims to investigate the impact of replacing classroom time with an online learning environment. The meta-analysis (k = 21 effect sizes) applied strict inclusion criteria concerning research design, measurement of learning outcomes and implementation of blended learning. The estimated effect size (Hedge's g) was positive, although not significantly different from zero and the confidence interval [-0.13, 0.25], suggesting that overall differences between blended and conventional classroom learning are small, and, at best, very small negative or moderate positive effects are plausible. This means that despite a reduction in classroom time between 30 and 79 per cent, equivalent learning outcomes were found. Consequently, blended learning with reduced classroom time is not systematically more or less effective than conventional classroom learning.},

In spite of more than 20 years of research in testing, most of testing techniques still focus on module testing and white-box testing. However, in practice, integration testing and functional testing have been found to be most useful and effective. To respond to this need, DoD recently initiates a project on End-to-End (E2E) integration testing. This approach takes the functional approach to integration testing even though design and architecture information can be also incorporated into the test specification. This approach also allows risk analysis, test case/script generation, regression testing, ripple effect analysis, statistical analysis, and remote project management and collaboration via XML.},

In this paper, we report the experience of using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in a CS1 programming course. We describe our motivation for choosing VS Code and how we introduce it to students. We create comprehensive guidance with hierarchical indexing to help students with diverse programming backgrounds. We perform an experimental evaluation of students' programming experience of using VS Code and validate the VS Code together with guidance as a promising solution for CS1 programming courses.},

In order to program in the cloud, lots of IDEs are also moved into the cloud at recent years. Although online IDE can bring developers a lot of convenience for their developing process, some tough problems are still less touched. This paper summarized three main kinds of actual problems from three aspects (Function implementation, Security guarantee, Advanced utilization) encountered when using the online IDE, and proposed three solutions (Services composition, Program behavior analysis, Program behavior mining) to handle these according problems. Finally, this paper introduce a real online IDE (CEclipse) developed by our research group and apply the three solutions in this online IDE.},
