However, it is difficult for instructors to find a suitable IDE that is beginner friendly and supports strong functionality. In this paper, we report the experience of using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) in a CS1 programming course. We describe our motivation for choosing VS Code and how we introduce it to students. We create comprehensive guidance with hierarchical indexing to help students with diverse programming backgrounds. We perform an experimental evaluation of students' programming experience of using VS Code and validate the VS Code together with guidance as a promising solution for CS1 programming courses.},

In order to program in the cloud, lots of IDEs are also moved into the cloud at recent years. Although online IDE can bring developers a lot of convenience for their developing process, some tough problems are still less touched. This paper summarized three main kinds of actual problems from three aspects (Function implementation, Security guarantee, Advanced utilization) encountered when using the online IDE, and proposed three solutions (Services composition, Program behavior analysis, Program behavior mining) to handle these according problems. Finally, this paper introduce a real online IDE (CEclipse) developed by our research group and apply the three solutions in this online IDE.},
